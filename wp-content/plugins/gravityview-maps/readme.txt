### Map Icons

GravityView Maps uses map icons from the [Maps Icons Collection by Nicolas Mollet](http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/). By default, a pre-selection of about 100 icons (from more than 700 available icons) has been added to the plugin.

2. Activate the plugin
3. Configure "Maps" via the Maps metabox when editing a View

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.2 on August 18, 2016 =
* Updated: "Zoom Control" setting has been simplified to "None", "Small", or "Default"; this is because Google Maps [no longer allows](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/releases#324) custom zoom control sizes
* Fixed: Don't render Maps widget if using a DataTables layout (we are hoping to support this in the future)
    * Also don't show Maps widget and fields in the Edit View screen when using a DataTables layout
* Fixed: Map not displaying when widget is in "Below Entries Widgets" zone
* Fixed: Javascript error when using the WordPress Customizer

__Developer Notes:__

* Allow global access to manipulate maps after instantiation ([see example](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/1fccef0835aacd6693903c96ba146973))
* Added ability to set `mobile_breakpoint` via the `gravityview/maps/render/options` filter
* `zoomControlOptions` no longer allows `style` value to be set; instead, only `position` is valid ([See example](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/630da145c8c813a48ba3b282b3610e5a))

= 1.4.1 on April 7, 2016 =
